The focus of the capstone project revolves around predicting the success of the first-stage landing for SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets. Notably, SpaceX promotes Falcon 9 rocket launches on its platform, pricing them at 62 million dollars, significantly less than other providers whose costs soar above 165 million dollars per launch. This substantial cost reduction stems primarily from SpaceX's capability to reuse the first stage of the rocket. By accurately predicting whether the first stage will successfully land, we can effectively estimate the overall cost of a launch. Such insights are invaluable for companies considering bidding against SpaceX for rocket launch contracts.
